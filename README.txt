=============================================

In a world where there is a shortage of the most flavorful fish found in the arctic... 
two groups of penguins are locked, loaded, and hungry. 

With their slippery bellies, rocket launchers, and jetpacks–nothing stands in the way of perfect chaos… 
and these penguins are flipped off! 

One group will rise; the other shall fall.
