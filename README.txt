[Explain Design].

The three forms of 3D physics that are used in WAP are player rigidbodies, rockets, and explosion particle effects.

The three AI techniques used in WAP include FSM <- Chris, path finding <- Jacob, and decision making <- Emily.

The three uses of Mecanim used are player rigged model <- Jacob, penguin eyes <- Chris, and main menu title <- Emily.

The above mentioned elements come together, with respect to gameplay and theme, by providing elements that make up the player's battleground.  
The AI techniques are using for simulating players where there are none.  
The physics constructs are the core of the game, allowing the player to assess multiple solutions to going forward in the game when accounting for momentum and the speeds of the rockets.   
Mecanim and the particle effects allow the game to characterize and communicate the chaos of the battlefield to the player.  
Other animations allow the game's menus to have more character and will in the future allow for smooth transitions for options that are not necessary yet.
